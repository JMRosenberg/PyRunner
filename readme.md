PyRunner

_PyRunner_ is a simple game based off of Sierra's _LodeRunner: The Legend Returns_.  I played this game a ton as a kid, and thought of it again when looking to build a sizable project in python.

_PyRunner_ uses Python 2.7.6 (although I plan to be testing on 3.4.0 as well), and PyGame.

Things to do:

 - Level editor
 - Main game loop (1 player/no monks, 1 player/yes monks, 2 player)
 - Start screen
 - Better graphics
 - Online high scores

These are obviously pretty high level.  A __Player__ class needs to be built first, among other important steps.  Also, existing code needs cleanup, and to be split into functions.
